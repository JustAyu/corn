<b>INFORMATION ABOUT SCRIPT AND DEV!</b>
<code>------------------------------</code>

Hi, This Script was made by Ayush A to Z! As you already seen that This script doesn't require session string. It's becouse session string can be used as userbot but not good for adding members due to high sensitive! So for account safety, I made this script as normal logging!

Soon I'll upgrade this script for supporting multiple account support if this script worked without any issue on one account!

PLEASE NOTE :
I made this script, I TRIED THIS SCRIPT ON MY 3 ACCOUNTS! It's working fine and didn't harmed my accounts!........BUT I'M NOT <b>responsible</b> If your account get banned or deleted! I'll just lough on you, SO USE ON YOUR RISK!

TIPS :
Add offline members in your members for growing your group

NOTICE:
Give star and credits to Ayush for making this useful script for everyone! and support me by joining your accounts in my channel @Life_codes

Thank You!
